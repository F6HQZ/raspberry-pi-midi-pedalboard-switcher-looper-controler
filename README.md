# Raspberry Pi Midi pedalboard (switcher-looper-controller)

An Open Source Open Hardware project for an ultimate midi foot controller for any musician needs

Inspired from my last project (electric guitar preamplifier) using Raspberry Pi Midi Audio Controller, driving rotary-encoders, I2C digital potentiometers (digipots), 24xLEDs-bargraphs used as real time true VU-Meters and Digipots position display, I2C LCD for displaying values and menues, and few dry loops as I/O controls. As I must add its Midi protocol support now, it's a natual extension to this last and current project to jump to a new one for a Midi pedalboard.

Will be writed in pure ANSI C language.

This project will grow in features (WEB GUI, API set for remote control, I/O Schematics and PCBs etc...) depending my available time and my pleasure as hobbyist.

This work is for my own needs first, but will be extended to everybody wanting to help me in my task or duplicate this work for his own.

As exemple, I need to understand all what people want as embedded functions, capabilities for this kind of "intelligent pedalboard" to avoid to forget some...
